        <h1>About Traaak</h1>
        <p>
        Traaak was created by individuals who are passionate about technology 
        and improvement of  customer experience and the idea was born because
        of challenges of using existing platforms to manage tasks related to the 
        post sales customer lifecycle. <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Our aim is to simplify the process of managing the activities related to a 
        post sales customer portfolio by bringing together the basic aspects of a 
        Customer Relationship Management and combining this with task 
        management tools allowing users to easily manage post-sales related 
        customer tasks and activities.
