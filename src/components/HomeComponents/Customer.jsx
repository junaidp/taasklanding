              Be well equipped to manage your customer post sales lifecycle from
              pre-boarding through to growth. Track and execute customer
              activities helping you build trust and hopefully repeat patronage.
              Bring all your trackers, spreadsheets, and customer documents into
              one single, easily accessible platform saving you time and effort.
              Tasks can be targeted towards customer in specific stages of the
              lifecycle or individually depending on what need to be achieved
              and a choice of notifications ensures that nothing is missed.
